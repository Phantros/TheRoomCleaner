# TheRoomCleaner
A prototype fps minigame

Thank your for playing my prototype; 'The Room Cleaner'. 

How To Play:
Open the StartScreenScene and start the application.
In the start screen, press the start button to start playing.
In the playing scene, press ESC to exit back to the start screen.
If the player finishes the game, the game navigates to the end screen. There you can either pick play again or go back to main. 

Controls:
WASD for movement
Left Shift for jumping
Mouse drag movement for looking with the camera
Left mouse click to shoot (If you've picked up an item)

Premise:
Clean your room! Pick up all the colored items in the room and shoot them at the target of the same color. Aim at the target points for a high score. 

Design:
Considering distraction from pain, some conributing factors are counting and doing puzzles. I've tried incorperating these elements in the game-mechanics. 
Since the target demographic is children, I chose for a colorful design, with different shaped objects for the eye. I've also chosen a simpler game-design. The puzzle elelemnt is shooting the correct colored bullet at the correctly colored target. The counting element is the score the player gets. 

There are two ways to finish the game. Either the player picked up and shot all the items, or the time runs out. 

Thematic design:
Considering the children demographic, I've chosen a theme that they know all too well. Clean your room. Maybe this helps turning something that's not fun into something that's fun. The stage is the bedroom, the collectable bullets/items are the objects to clean and the colored walls are the correct storing spaces for the items. Clean your room as quickly as possible, with the highest score possible! 

Iteration possibilities:
The player controls are very simplistic. No use of a character controller nor of the new Input System from Unity. This could be improved. The jump function is a bit broken. Sometimes the grounded bool doesn't react as I wanted it to. 
The collectable objects are basic shapes. Some models of small items found in most bedrooms would improve the environment. 
Also, considering accessibility, the shapes could get different colors, different shapes, maybe even numbers or letters. 
The room obstacles are all cubes shapes. Some models of big items found in most bedrooms would improve the environment. I.E. a bed, a closet, a dresser, etc. 

Thank you once again for playing my prototype, I hope everything was clear.

With Regards,

Nick Wijker
